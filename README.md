<br>
<p>As a user that wants to find out some infomation about a species but only has a mobile phone to research it, I need to be able to navigate the site easily to locate my animal and read through detailed infomation all on a small screen.</p>

<br>
<h4>Strategy</h4>
<p>My design goal was to make it as easy as possible to navigate the website and also read detailed imfomation but in an uncluttered space.</p>
<br>
<h4>Scope</h4>
<p>For my users, I wanted to give them the passion, knowledge and motivation to help endangered species accross the world. This way they could obtain crutial infomation and feel they can make a difference.</p>
<br>
<h4>Structure</h4>
<p>I have used a suquential structure in my site to help the user navigate the site in a clear and simple way and help them access the imfomation they're looking for. I achieved this by creating a simple navbar and holding all infomation on one single page that they can either scroll through or jump straight to one part that they desire.</p>
