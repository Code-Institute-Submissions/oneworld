										<h4><b>Facts:</b></h4>
										<p>Once common throughout Africa and Asia, elephants have declined significantly
											during the 20th century, largely due to the illegal ivory trade. Though some
											populations are now stable and growing, poaching, human-elephant conflict,
											and habitat destruction continue to threaten the species.
											Elephants are the largest land mammals on earth and have distinctly massive
											bodies, large ears, and long trunks. They use their trunks to pick up
											objects, trumpet warnings, greet other elephants, or suck up water for
											drinking or bathing, among other uses. Both male and female African
											elephants grow tusks and each individual can either be left- or
											right-tusked, and the one they use more is usually smaller because of wear
											and tear. Elephant tusks serve many purposes. These extended teeth can be
											used to protect the elephant's trunk, lift and move objects, gather food,
											and strip bark from trees. They can also be used for defense. During times
											of drought, elephants even use their tusks to dig holes to find water
											underground.

											<h4><b>Facts:</b></h4>
											<p>Seven different species of sea (or marine) turtles grace our ocean
												waters, from the shallow seagrass beds of the Indian Ocean, to the
												colorful reefs of the Coral Triangle and the sandy beaches of the
												Eastern Pacific. While these highly migratory species periodically come
												ashore to either bask or nest, sea turtles spend the bulk of their lives
												in the ocean. OneWorld's work on sea turtles focuses on five of those
												species: green, hawksbill, loggerhead, leatherback, and olive ridley.

												Over the last 200 years, human activities have tipped the scales against
												the survival of these ancient mariners. Slaughtered for their eggs,
												meat, skin, and shells, sea turtles suffer from poaching and
												over-exploitation. They also face habitat destruction and accidental
												capture—known as bycatch—in fishing gear. Climate change has an impact
												on turtle nesting sites; it alters sand temperatures, which then affects
												the sex of hatchlings. Nearly all species of sea turtle are now
												classified as endangered, with three of the seven existing species being
												critically endangered.

														<h4><b>Facts:</b></h4>
														<p>People usually think of leopards in the savannas of Africa
															but in the Russian Far East, a rare subspecies has adapted
															to life in the temperate forests that make up the
															northern-most part of the species’ range. Similar to other
															leopards, the Amur leopard can run at speeds of up to 37
															miles per hour. This incredible animal has been reported to
															leap more than 19 feet horizontally and up to 10 feet
															vertically.

															The Amur leopard is solitary. Nimble-footed and strong, it
															carries and hides unfinished kills so that they are not
															taken by other predators. It has been reported that some
															males stay with females after mating, and may even help with

															<p>Polar bears are classified as marine mammals because they
																spend most of their lives on the sea ice of the Arctic
																Ocean. They have a thick layer of body fat and a
																water-repellant coat that insulates them from the cold
																air and water. Considered talented swimmers, they can
																sustain a pace of six miles per hour by paddling with
																their front paws and holding their hind legs flat like a
																rudder.

																Polar bears spend over 50% of their time hunting for
																food. A polar bear might catch only one or two out of
																ten seals it hunts, depending on the time of year and
																other variables. Their diet mainly consists of ringed
																and bearded seals because they need large amounts of fat
																to survive.

																Scientists have divided the total polar bear population
																into 19 units or subpopulations. Of those, the latest
																data from the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group show that
																one subpopulation is in decline (Southern Beaufort Sea)
																and that there is a high estimated risk of future
																decline due to climate change and data deficiency.

																Because of ongoing and potential loss of their sea ice
																habitat resulting from climate change, polar bears were
																listed as a threatened species in the US under the
																Endangered Species Act in May 2008.

																		<h4><b>Facts:</b></h4>
																		<p>Rhinos once roamed many places throughout
																			Europe, Asia, and Africa and were known to
																			early Europeans who depicted them in cave
																			paintings. At the beginning of the 20th
																			century, 500,000 rhinos roamed Africa and
																			Asia. By 1970, rhino numbers dropped to
																			70,000, and today, as few as 29,000 rhinos
																			remain in the wild. Very few rhinos survive
																			outside national parks and reserves due to
																			persistent poaching and habitat loss over
																			many decades. Three species of rhino—black,
																			Javan, and Sumatran—are critically
																			endangered. Today, a small population of
																			Javan rhinos is found in only one national
																			park on the northern tip of the Indonesian
																			island of Java. A mainland subspecies of the
																			Javan rhino was declared extinct in Vietnam
																			in 2011. Successful conservation efforts
																			have led to an increase in the number of
																			greater one-horned (or Indian) rhinos, from
																			around 200 at the turn of the 20th century
																			to more than 3,700 today. The greater
																			one-horned rhino is one of Asia’s biggest
																			success stories, with their status improving
																			from endangered to vulnerable following
																			significant population increases. However,
																			the species still remains under threat from
																			poaching for its horn and from habitat loss
																			and degradation.

																			In Africa, southern white rhinos, once
																			thought to be extinct, now thrive in
																			protected sanctuaries and are classified as
																			near threatened. But the western black rhino
																			and northern white rhinos have recently
																			become extinct in the wild. The only two
																			remaining northern white rhino are kept
																			under 24-hour guard in Ol Pejeta Conservancy
																			in Kenya. Black rhinos have doubled in
																			number over the past two decades from their
																			low point of fewer than 2,500 individuals,
																			but total numbers are still a fraction of
																			the estimated 100,000 that existed in the
																			early part of the 20th century.

																			<h4><b>Facts:</b></h4>
																			<p>Gorillas are gentle giants and display
																				many human-like behaviors and emotions,
																				such as laughter and sadness. In fact,
																				gorillas share 98.3% of their genetic
																				code with humans, making them our
																				closest cousins after chimpanzees and
																				bonobos. The largest of the great apes,
																				gorillas are stocky animals with broad
																				chests and shoulders, large, human-like
																				hands, and small eyes set into hairless
																				faces. The two gorilla species live in
																				equatorial Africa, separated by about
																				560 miles of Congo Basin forest. Each
																				has a lowland and upland subspecies.
																				Gorillas live in family groups of
																				usually five to 10, but sometimes two to
																				more than 50, led by a dominant adult
																				male—or silverback—who holds his
																				position for years. The bond between the
																				silverback and his females forms the
																				basis of gorilla social life. Females
																				become sexually mature around seven or
																				eight years old but don’t begin to breed
																				until a couple of years later. Males
																				mature at an even greater age. Once a
																				female begins to breed, she'll likely
																				give birth to only one baby every four
																				to six years and only three or four over
																				her entire lifetime. This low rate of
																				reproduction makes it difficult for
																				gorillas to recover from population
																				declines. Both gorilla species have been
																				decreasing in numbers for decades, and a
																				2010 United Nations report suggests that
																				they may disappear from large parts of
																				the Congo Basin by the mid-2020s.

																				Conservation efforts by OneWorld, other
																				organizations, and governments are
																				making a difference for gorillas. New
																				protected areas are being designated for
																				some gorilla populations, and the
																				population of mountain gorillas has
																				continued to increase in recent years,
																				leading to its downlisting from
																				Critically Endangered to Endangered in
																				November 2018.
